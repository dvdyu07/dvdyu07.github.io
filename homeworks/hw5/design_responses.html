                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I learned that there are a variety of animations that designers can use to make their projects look better and provide a better user experience. I learned that you can make edges bend with animations. I also learnd that sometimes simple is better.</p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of the article was seeing all of the different animations. They give me a lot of inspiration and motivate me to create cool designs like theirs. The most interesting one, however, is seeing the animation of the woman walking, and then it sstops and blends into the background as a picture, and then you can scroll. I wonder how they do that. I'm also interested in how people come up with these animation ideas.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I think Prism studio was my favorite. I love their use of the gray scale, using Black as the main color and grey and white as accent colors. Not only that, bu t heir animations were so cool, and the page flowed like perfectly. They succeeded in showcasing their tattoo studio, their artists, their art, as well as including the logistics after. The whole scrolling page with the animations adding the finish touch is magnificent.</p>

                            <p> 10/10 There was no reading, just pure animations and inspirations. I love this because it was super cool seeing all of the different inspirations and animations that people came up with.</p>
