        Hi! My name is David and I love to play video games and explore good food. 
        On my free time, I like to go to the gym, watch anime, and hang out with friends. 
        I have a twin brother that looks exactly like me, who goes to Boston University and I immigrated from China when I was 7 years old.
        Currently, I am taking 20 units for absolutely no reason; I don't even know how I got here.
        But yea, I am excited to learn web development!

        These are currently my favorite places to eat at Berkeley.

                I learned that design encompasses many different aspects of the user experience, including appeal, prompting people to think certain things, and guidance. 
                I also learned that designers don't just naturally have a good eye for design or have the creativity for it, they have to build it by feeding and analyzing other apps.

                My favorite part of the article was seeing the GIFs that the author put, it was a very good representation of the workflow that designers follow. 
                It was interesting to see the choices that people make when it comes to design.
