						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> That typography is key to setting the tone, mood, and style of a design. When the design is illustration heavy, it is good to have a typography that harmonizes the design. We should keep font pairing simple with a max of 3 fonts. There are many websites that help with creating the different elements of design and I learn that design isn't as easy as I thought.</p>
