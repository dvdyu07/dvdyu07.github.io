							<p> Animations shows interactions between screens, explains how to use the application or simply directs a user’s attention. The optimal speed for interface animation is between 200 and 500 ms. Any animation shorter than 100 ms is instantaneous and won’t be recognized at all. There are different optimal animation duration times for different-size devices.</p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was being able to learn about optimizing the animations. It's cool how they were able to throw in so many aspects, even as far as to use physics to explain. Learning about the curves were super interesting too. </p>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
