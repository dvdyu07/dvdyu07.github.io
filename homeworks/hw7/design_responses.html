							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that Gestalt (form, shape in German) is a group of visual perception principles developed by German psychologists in 1920s. Gestalt principles are built on 4 ideas: Emergence, Reification, Multi_stability, and Invariance. Emergence is when People tend to identify elements first in their general outlined form. Our brain recognises a simple, well-defined object quicker than a detailed one. Reification is when People can recognise objects even when there are parts of them missing. Our brain matches what we see with familiar patterns stored in our memory and fills in the gaps. Multi-Stability is when People will often interpret ambiguous objects in more than one ways. Our brains will bounce back and forth between the alternatives seeking certainty. As a result, one view will become more dominant while the other one will get harder to see. Lastly, Invariance is when People can recognise simple objects independently of their rotation, scale and translation. Our brain can perceive objects from different perspectives, despite their different appearance.

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Learning and seeing the different design principles in action was really cool. I didn't expect design to have so many elements to it. The different names for these ideas are also very cool, like common fate was an interesting aspect. </p>
